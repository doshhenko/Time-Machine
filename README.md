# Time-Machine

Time Machine is an interactive, story-driven web application that allows users to explore fictional worlds inspired by movies and TV shows. By answering a series of questions, users are taken on a personalized journey through time — to the pas or present — and receive a creative storyline based on their choices.

## Features

- Single-page application built entirely with JavaScript
- Dynamic content rendering — no multiple HTML files, only DOM manipulation
- Branching logic based on user answers
- Adaptive storytelling: different storylines based on each user's decisions
- Final result: a fictional universe and an original mission within it

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth and engaging UI transitions
- Responsive Design for both desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

1. The user begins the journey with a simple question:  
   *To get stuck in the past or to stay in the present, which do you prefer, gentlemen travelers?*
2. Each answer affects the next question.
3. After 3–7 questions, the app generates a unique result — a fictional scenario based on popular media.
4. The content (images, text, buttons) dynamically changes without page reloads, providing a seamless SPA experience.


## Folder Structure

- index.html — single HTML page
- css/ — stylesheet files
- js/ — JavaScript logic controlling the quiz and rendering
- assets/ — images and fonts
